# Nerf Roulette

After cleaning out your room, you stumble across an old Nerf N-Strike Maverick REV-6 (pictured below) that your parents bought you almost a decade and half ago. You also happen to find a singular Nerf N-Strike Elite Universal Suction Dart. Since you are really bored, you decide to play a game of Nerf roulette.
